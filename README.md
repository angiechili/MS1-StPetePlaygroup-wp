# St Peter's Playgroup Website
 
## Overview
The idea from this project came after I started my search for childcare in my local area. 
I was unable to find a suitable option through web search, so I decided to ask around and by word of my mouth I found a perfect match in St Peter's playgroup.
St Peter's Playgroup does not have a website, so I would've not been able to find it, if I relied on a web search alone.
I thought it a shame that such a great quality childcare setting does not have an online platform to showcase their work and attract new clients.
